# Felipe's Node.js examen

Hey **Jorne**! Here is my miserable attempt at making sense of what I've learned.

## GET /api/snippets

Status: 200 OK

I am currently able to fetch all snippets from the database.

## POST /api/snippets

Status: 201 Created

### Error message:

On snippetRoutes.ts there is an issue with getSnippetById: 'No overload matches this call.'

I don't really understand Codeium's explanation.

## GET /api/snippets/:id

Status: 200 OK

I'm able to get snippets by ID.

### Error message:

'No overload matches this call.'

## DELETE /api/snippets/:id

Status: 200 OK

I'm able to delete snippets by ID.

### Error message:

'No overload matches this call.'

## PUT /api/snippets/:id

Status: 200 OK

### Error message:

'No overload matches this call.'

## EJS

The files are made, but I was unable to render the page at all.

Surely I'm overseeing some detail, so I've commented the lines on **server.ts**.
